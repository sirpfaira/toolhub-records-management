# Toolhub Management Tool

#### This is a Web Application for recording and modifying attributes of various tools which are in the Toolhub.

### You can view the [live website ](https://example.com) which is hosted on Vercel.

# Introduction

Toolhub is a community catalog of tools used across many Wiki projects. Its usefulness as such is directly linked to the amount
and quality of information it contains. Currently, many tools in Toolhub have missing or incomplete information. While editing this
information directly through Toolhub is of course possible, a more streamlined and gamified way with a dedicated UI could make
editing faster and more enjoyable.
The inspiration for this project is the tool Citation Hunt. Built for Wikipedia, it allows users to add missing citations without having
to search for them across Wikipedia itself. It is available in many different languages and has a 30-day leaderboard. The goal
is to make a similar tool for Toolhub.
